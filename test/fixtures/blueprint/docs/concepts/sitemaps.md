# Sitemaps

A Sitemap is an inventory of all of the available screens or pages in a
typical User Interface, whether that exists in the form of a website,
single page webapp, or native mobile application.

Each screen will usually reference a `Wireframe`, `Mockup` or point to a
staging or production URL.
