# Features

Features are the smallest unit of work the Blueprint will define and
track.  A Feature is something that can be prioritized, estimated, and
delivered to the `Client` or `Product Owner` for `Acceptance Testing`.

A `Feature` is typically supported by `Wireframes` and/or `API Endpoint
Documentation` and may reference different `Concepts`.  This is so that
the person who is working on the `Feature` has all of the materials they
need and access to all of the relevant information to be effective.
