# Living Documents

When we refer to the Blueprint as a Living Document, what we mean is
that unlike static or dead documents which are written and shared,
even ones which are diligently updated and maintained, the Blueprint is
capable of keeping itself up to date and relevant.

The Blueprint describes work to be done in a software project.  This
work gets checked into source control, deployed to staging and
production, saved in Dropbox or Google Drive.  The Blueprint integrates
with a large number of third party systems and APIs, and is able to
respond to these events and relate them back to documents in the
blueprint, updating content or data in the blueprint as necessary.
