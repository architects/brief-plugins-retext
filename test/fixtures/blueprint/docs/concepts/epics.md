# Epics 

Epics are an arbitrary but logical grouping of `Features`.  Epics may
exist in multiple `projects`.  We may have a 'User Signup' epic that spans
a Mobile App, Web App, and Backend `Project` for example.

Epics will define and reference one or more `Features` which are the
smallest unit of work we track, estimate, and deliver for acceptance.
