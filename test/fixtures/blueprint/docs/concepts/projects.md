# Projects

A Project typically refers to a single codebase, for example a Ruby on
Rails application or iOS Application. A Project is something that,
usually, a single team will be responsible for.  

A Blueprint for a complex product may contain multiple Projects, in
different programming languages for multiple distribution Platforms such
as Web, iOS, Android, etc.

Projects which describe some sort of User Interface will usually have a
Sitemap which defines the different screens or pages.  

Projects will have one or more Epics, which are used to group and
categorize all of the different Features that are part of the Project.
