# Brief - The Active Writing Framework

Brief brings the documents we write to life by treating them not just as
written communication, but also as relational data, and active record
objects with attributes that can be updated, queried, aggregated, and
used in command line applications and API integrations.

It does this through the use of Markdown, YAML Frontmatter, and highly
customizable Document Models which define the structure, requirements,
and relationships different pieces of writing have with each other and
other pieces of data in the world.
