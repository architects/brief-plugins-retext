# The Blueprint.io Webapp

The Blueprint.io Webapp allows people to manage their blueprint projects
settings such as collaborators, and publishing settings.

A Company which signs up on Blueprint.io will have their own Subdomain
(e.g. architects.blueprint.io)

A blueprint project for this company would be visible at
architects.blueprint.io/my-project.
