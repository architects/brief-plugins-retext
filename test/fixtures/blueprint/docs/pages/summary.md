# Summary

A Blueprint is a `Living Document` that can follow the creation of software
from the time it is conceptualized and as it makes its way through the
many stages of definition, design, development, iteration, and
maintenance.

The purpose of the Blueprint is to facilitate understanding and serve
as a central place for all of the different roles of people involved in
bringing a software product to users. 

To this end, a Blueprint captures many different kinds of writing and
documents that we commonly use when designing and building software.

- Domain Concepts
- Epics
- Features or User Stories
- Personas or User Roles
- Project Definitions and Summaries
- Notes and General Information
- Sitemaps
- Flowcharts
- Diagrams
- Release Notes
- Roadmaps and Milestones
- Proposals
- Scopes of Work (for Contracts) 
- Estimates
- Wireframes and Mockups
- API Documentation 
- Class Diagrams and Documentation
- Metrics (Business, Technical, User Engagement, etc)

Blueprints themselves are created through a cross platform Desktop App
that is capable of integrating with the local development versions of
projects as well as remote APIs.

The Blueprints can be published to a group website and password
protected.  People can log
