# Working With Blueprints

A Blueprint will exist as a folder on somebody's hard drive.  This
folder will contain a bunch of markdown files, YAML files, JSON files,
image assets, or other files.

We need to be able to import blueprints from the file system, create new
blueprints, download blueprints from a remote server, upload blueprints
to a remote server, publish blueprints as password protected websites,
and a lot more.

## Features

### An Architect can import existing Blueprints

As an **Architect** I would like to **import an existing blueprint** so
that I can **collaborate with others and share work across different
machines**

### An Architect can publish a Blueprint on Blueprint.io

As an **Architect** I would like to **publish my blueprints online** so
that **people can view the blueprint online**

### An Architect can create new Blueprints

As an **Architect** I would like to **create new blueprints** so that I
can **capture and define software project ideas**
